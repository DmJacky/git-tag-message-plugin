<div>
  If the revision checked out has a git tag associated with it, and a message
  was specified when creating the tag, then that message will be exported during
  the build as the <tt>GIT_TAG_MESSAGE</tt> environment variable.
  <p/>
  If the revision has more than one tag associated with it, only the most recent
  tag will be taken into account. For this reason, if you're using the "Create a
  tag for every build" behaviour, make sure that it occurs after this behaviour.
